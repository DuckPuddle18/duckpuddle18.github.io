<h2> first I started out with a nmap scan which revealed ports 22, 80, 445, 139, 3306, and 6667
<br> <img src="nmap.PNG"> 
<br> saw that port 80 was open and decided to check it out, but didn't find much
<br> <img src="website.PNG"> 
<br> after looking at the website, i checked the shares on the server
<br><img src="SMB_shares.PNG"> 
<br> mounted the share labeled "share$"
<br><img src="mountingSMB.PNG"> 
<br> saw there was a file labeled "deets.txt" which had a password in it
<br><img src="password.PNG"> 
<br> now that we have a password, all that we need is a user
<br> decided to enumerate some more and chose to use enum4linux
<br>
<img src="enum4linux.PNG"> 
<br> when the scan was finished, it gave me a user for "togie"
<br> 
<img src="user.PNG"> 
<br> now that i have a user and a password, i tried logging into SSH which worked
<br>
<img src="togie login.PNG"> 
<br> I had very limited commands so I decided to try some privilege escalation 
<br><img src="privesc.PNG"> 
<br> now that we got extra commands, I navigated to "/" and saw there was a folder labeled root
<br> it wouldnt let me change directories into it so I changed its ownership to me using chown
<br><img src="chown root.PNG"> 
<br> now that I have ownership of that directory, I changed directories into it and was able to gain the flag
<br> <img src="root.PNG"> 
<br> SUCCESS!
<br> I hope you enjoyed my writeup
